# Movie Saga

## Description
It was really fun working on this app.
Worked with React-Redux, Redux-Saga and database sql.
Started by  creating a database named `saga_movies_weekend` and ran the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database

initially began the project by installing

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`
3. `npm run client`

# More Description
This API uses react, redux and saga. It uses dispatch for client side communication and axios for sending data from client to server side. It uses pg for connecting with an outside database in Postico. Using reducers the data can be stored and grabbed in house with useSelectors. The 'movie posters' and 'back' button uses use history for navigation. HashRouter and Route are both used for displaying components to the DOM and all the styling has been done on CSS, which I find is very much fun to play with.
